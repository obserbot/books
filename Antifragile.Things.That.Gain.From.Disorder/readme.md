# 《反脆弱 - 从无序中获益》


3星

The idea of the book is very interesting and is filled with examples and anecdotes which help clarify the concept and its implications. It is very interesting how such an important concept with clear implications in multiple contexts has flown under the radar by academics and professionals. I have read other books by the same author, had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. However, I cannot stop thinking that it could have been written in half the pages.His mix of informal prose, references to classic literature, self-congratulation, grandiose explanations, and real-world stories are tiring at some points. It took me much longer to read than usual because I often got saturated with his style. It sat at my table for months while I read four other books in-between.

I wish there were a way to give more nuance when assigning starts to a review. 5 starts to what the book is about, 1 star to how is written.

Oh, Taleb. You make it so hard to not use vulgar language in my review.

This book, which introduces and describes the concept of antifragility, is pretty revolutionary. Few books have fundamentally changed the way I think about the world, and this is one of them. My understanding of risk and how to address it has shifted dramatically, and the application of the concepts discussed has yielded surprising results.

That being said, the author is as pretentious as they come. Expect a lot of fancy-pants language for no reason other than to show off, and off-topic stories to illustrate just how much better than the rest of mankind Taleb is.

For example, “We gave the appellation ‘antifragile’ to such a package; a neologism was necessary as there is no simple, noncompound word in the Oxford English Dictionary that expresses the point of reverse fragility.”

*facepalm*

It is a frustrating read to say the least. It took me a couple months to slog through this book because of how frequently I wanted to punch Taleb in the teeth, but the content is 100% worth it.

This author is just too full of himself. Some years ago I started Black Swan but gave up midway because there was just too much self-congratulation over his rather limited insight that “the future is unpredictable”.

This book is more of the same, only worse.

From one paragraph to the next, odd “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” factoids and impenetrable/simplistic metaphors are thrown at you, with little pretense at logical sequence. (Taleb tries to explain away the lack of continuity by saying that he’s really writing four different books here, and that in fact, all his past books form a grand oeuvre which you must read the entirety of to appreciate.) Taleb pontificates - hands down the truth from his pulpit - on one subject after another; to underscore his erudition, every few pages he throws in a phrase in Latin or French that he then translates - for the benefit of the less-erudite-than-him readers - into English. It’s tiresome and even a bit sad, like hearing someone at a cocktail party trying to impress you with her social credentials.

The final takeaways? Embrace randomness and unpredictability. Be wary of over-regulation (obsessive attempts to prepare against the unpredictable). The French over-regulate and are successful but can’t in the end be considered to over-regulate because many of the French are really not French anyway [absolutely sic]. It is better to be poor and indifferent (have no goals) because then you cannot be harmed by life’s vicissitudes. If you don’t understand my point [implies Taleb] it’s because you’re stupid, and if you protest my inability to express a simple, clear, and understandable thought, I will just walk out on you [as he proudly recounted doing when a radio talk host asked him to explain something better].

In sum, this book is nothing but the random musings and rants of a windbag.

### 非预测性

我们几乎总能使用一个简单的不对称测试来检测反脆弱性和脆弱性：**从随机事件（或一定冲击）中获得的有利结果大于不利结果的，就是反脆弱性的，反之则是脆弱性的**。
